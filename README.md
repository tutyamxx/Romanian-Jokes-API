# Romanian Jokes API üëåüòπ 
 * Just a dumb API which returns dumb romanian jokes made when I died of boredom
 * I need to add more dumb jokes and new things in the future
 * I might host it somewhere someday.

# How to run it
* Clone this repo
* Open the containing folder
* Type **npm i && npm start**
* Open the API in your browser http://localhost:3000/api/

# For consuming

* Rule is simple, jokes are returned in JSON format
* Long jokes tend to have new line separators ‚û°Ô∏è \\n
* To implement it in your bot, website, widget and add formatting, simply search and replace the new line separators in string with your custom formatting.
